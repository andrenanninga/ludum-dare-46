> Ludum Dare is an online event where games are made from scratch in a weekend. Check us out every April and October!

## Theme: "Keep it alive"

Puzzle game where you move a battery (round or rectangular) into the correct orientation. Every move flips or rolls the battery. The goal is to position the battery correctly into a socket to power a device keeping it alive.

```
...........   ...........   ...........
....[+]....   ...........   ....[-]....
....|█|.... → ........... → ....|█|....
....[-]....   ..[-]█[+]..   ....[+]....
...........   ...........   ...........
```

**Other ideas:**

- Grow a plant, control both roots and stalks at the same time. One captures water other captures sunlight. Somehow balance both sides.

- Keep a city alive, provide deliveries.
